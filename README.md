# fetidbot
This is a telegram bot that represents a personality of my little kitten - Vanya. She stinks, but only metaphorically. That's why fetidbot.

Basically, it just sends random photos of my kitten Vanya from my Imgur album to make one's day better :)

This bot uses **pyTelegramBotAPI** for telegram connection. It is deployed on **heroku** platform and uses heroku's **PostgreSQL** database to track sent photos and notify me, when somebody has already seen all available photos, so I can easily send photo to a bot and it will be automatically uploaded to a server and all such users will be notified.
